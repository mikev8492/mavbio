During clean room operations, an automated cell counter (NC-200) was used to measure cell density. Duplicate measurements were performed to account for variance, which required the manufacturing staff to calculate percent difference and totals between replicates. To streamline the process and reduce errors, I developed a tool to automatically calculate cell count, viability, and percent difference between the replicates. 

The original tool was written as a macro-enabled excel workbook that the manufacturing team could access on the shared drive from a laptop in the clean-room. After building the tool and allowing the team to peform user testing, I wrote and executed a validation report to allow for GMP use. 

The tool would indicate when variance was out of specification so the user could repeat measurements. After obtaining an acceptable average, the user could then print a pdf report to sign and date.
