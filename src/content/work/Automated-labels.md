  In-Process label templates.

#### Background:

GMP cell culture processes require in-process labeling of all reagents and product vessels (in this case, cell stacks and G-Rex flasks). Manufacturing teams often use a word label template where they manually enter information such as the current date, lot number and manually calculate the expiration date (for reagent labeling). This added time to prepping documentation for the cleanroom, and presented a point for user error as the expiration date could be calculated wrong and used for labeling. 

#### Overview:
I took the MS Word label templates and added a dialog box to prompt the user to enter the required information (lot number and manufacturing date or current date) and auto-populated the information in the label fields. For reagent labels, I added a VBA function to calculate the expiration date based on the SOP defined duration.
